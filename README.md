# Multiple-Obstacle-Overcoming-Rover-with-Smart-Indicator
The current study introduces a fresh concept: the rover recognizes many objects and successfully navigates around them while staying on its intended course. The precision of the rover's obstacle detection has also improved. In addition, compared to the previous project, it has increased the area for identifying obstacles. The system now features a new feature called Smart Indicators. The fact that the rover maintains its initial route after navigating the obstacle is among its most important benefits. In essence, this robot is an obstacle detecting robot using an Arduino platform. At first, the robot moves along the course as intended, but it stops when ultrasonic sensors identify an obstacle in its way. After that, it decides which course of action is most effective to avoid the obstacle.The rover now passes over the obstruction and maintains its course by making appropriate turns
